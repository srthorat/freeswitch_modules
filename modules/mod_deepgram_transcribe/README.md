# mod_deepgram_transcribe

A Freeswitch module that generates real-time transcriptions on a Freeswitch channel by using Deepgram's streaming transcription API.

## Features

- Real-time streaming transcription via Deepgram API
- Speaker diarization to identify different speakers
- Keyword boosting for improved recognition of specific terms
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for detecting entities like names, dates, amounts
- Profanity filtering
- Automatic punctuation and capitalization
- Redaction of sensitive information (PCI, SSN, etc.)
- Search for specific keywords in transcripts
- Custom word replacement
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with configurable endpointing
- Multiple model options (general, phonecall, meeting, voicemail, etc.)
- Numerals formatting (automatic conversion of spoken numbers)
- Interim and final transcription results

## Dependencies

- **libwebsockets** - Required for WebSocket connectivity to Deepgram API
- FreeSWITCH 1.8 or later

## Building

See the main [repository README](../../README.md) for complete build instructions. This module requires FreeSWITCH to be built with libwebsockets support.

The [ansible-role-fsmrf](https://github.com/drachtio/ansible-role-fsmrf) provides automated builds with all dependencies, or you can install libwebsockets manually:

```bash
apt-get install -y libwebsockets-dev
```

## API

### Commands

The freeswitch module exposes the following API commands:

```
uuid_deepgram_transcribe <uuid> start <lang-code> [interim]
```
Attaches media bug to channel and performs streaming recognize request.
- `uuid` - unique identifier of Freeswitch channel
- `lang-code` - a valid language code supported by Deepgram (e.g., en-US, en-GB, es, fr, de)
- `interim` - If the 'interim' keyword is present then both interim and final transcription results will be returned; otherwise only final transcriptions will be returned

```
uuid_deepgram_transcribe <uuid> stop
```
Stop transcription on the channel.

Fired when an error occurs during transcription. Contains error details in the event body.

## Usage

### Using drachtio-fsmrf

When using [drachtio-fsmrf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/drachtio-fsmrf), you can access this API command via the api method on the 'endpoint' object.

```javascript
// Basic transcription
await ep.set({
  DEEPGRAM_API_KEY: 'your-api-key',
  DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_MODEL: 'phonecall'
});
ep.api('uuid_deepgram_transcribe', `${ep.uuid} start en-US interim`);

// With speaker diarization and keyword boosting
await ep.set({
  DEEPGRAM_API_KEY: 'your-api-key',
  DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_MODEL: 'meeting',
  DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_TIER: 'nova',
  DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_DIARIZE: 'true',
  DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_KEYWORDS: 'pricing:3,discount:2,payment:2',
  DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_NER: 'true'
});
ep.api('uuid_deepgram_transcribe', `${ep.uuid} start en interim`);

// Stop transcription
ep.api('uuid_deepgram_transcribe', `${ep.uuid} stop`);
```

### Using FreeSWITCH Dialplan

```xml
<extension name="deepgram_transcribe">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^transcribe$">
    <action application="answer"/>
    <action application="set" data="DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-api-key"/>
    <action application="set" data="DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_MODEL=phonecall"/>
    <action application="set" data="DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_TIER=nova"/>
    <action application="set" data="DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_DIARIZE=true"/>
    <action application="set" data="DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_PUNCTUATION=true"/>
    <action application="uuid_deepgram_transcribe" data="start en-US interim"/>
    <action application="park"/>
  </condition>
</extension>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you see authentication errors:
1. Verify your Deepgram API key is correct
2. Check that your API key has sufficient credits/quota
3. Ensure the API key hasn't expired

### No Transcription Results

If you're not receiving transcription events:
1. Check FreeSWITCH logs for connection errors
2. Verify the language code is supported
3. Ensure audio is being captured (check media bug attachment)
4. Verify network connectivity to Deepgram endpoints
5. Check your Deepgram account has available credits

### Speaker Diarization Not Working

If speaker labels are not appearing:
1. Ensure `DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_DIARIZE` is set to "true"
2. Speaker diarization requires sufficient audio with multiple speakers
3. Works best with clear audio and distinct speakers
4. Some languages may have limited diarization support

### Poor Transcription Quality

To improve transcription accuracy:
1. Use the appropriate model for your use case (phonecall, meeting, etc.)
2. Consider upgrading to enhanced or nova tier
3. Use keyword boosting for domain-specific terms: `DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_KEYWORDS: 'term1:3,term2:2'`
4. Ensure good audio quality (8kHz minimum, 16kHz recommended)
5. Enable automatic punctuation for better readability

### Keyword Boosting

Boost recognition of specific terms using intensifiers:
```javascript
DEEPGRAM_SPEECH_KEYWORDS: 'Freeswitch:3,VoIP:2,transcription:2'
```
Intensifiers range from -10 to 10, where higher values increase likelihood of detection.

### Connection Issues

If experiencing connection problems:
1. Verify libwebsockets is properly installed
2. Check firewall rules allow outbound WebSocket connections
3. Ensure DNS can resolve Deepgram endpoints
4. Check network latency - Deepgram has global endpoints

## Examples

See the examples directory for sample applications demonstrating Deepgram transcription with FreeSWITCH.
